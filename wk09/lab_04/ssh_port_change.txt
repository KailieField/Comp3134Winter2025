----------------------------[ TASK J.8 : CHANGING THE SSH PORT ]----------------------------

[ STEP 6 ]:

------------ sudo service ssh restart

sudo :: super user do :: running commands with root/admin privileges

service :: talking to the init system :: allows for starting, stopping, restarting or checking the status of said services

ssh :: { service } :: gaining control of the service (OpenSSH server) 
---------- UBUNTU Note: typically managed under ssh (binary is sshd -- hence sshd_config)

restart :: the { action } I need to perform on the ssh service :: stop and start :: needed in order to implement the sshd_config file changes


EN ANGLAIS: At the root, please restart the service that handles incoming SSH connections
