-------------[ INJECTION SUMMARY ]-------------

-- If you query the firstname of the user within the database it will return the user and their information

-- only the injection attack ' OR '1'='1 populates all of the user from within the database

-- either way this means that the app is vulnerable to SQL Injection if the user is input without sanitization.

--- this allows users to manipulate the database via SQL queries 

In getusers_2.php, the prepared statement is used to safely bind the user input, thus preventing SQL injection.
